# UnarXive-2024
This project presents an updated and extended version of the UnarXive dataset, a large-scale full-text scholarly corpus derived from arXiv. We process and structure over 3 million papers, preserving rich document content and enriching metadata. Our pipeline enhances section-level grouping while maintaining compatibility with existing formats.
